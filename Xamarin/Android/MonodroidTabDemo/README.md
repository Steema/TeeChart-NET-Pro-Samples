MonodroidTabDemo
================

This is an application showing the usage of TeeChart for Xamarin.Android in a tabbed application. 

Examples here are a little varied. One shows how to combine multiple chart sytles in one single chart and allows pinch zooming and panning as an image. The second one displays an area chart with pinch zooming and panning live refreshing the chart on the canvas. The third one is a static 2D pie and the last one is a circular gauge with a numeric gauge embedded on it which monitor the device battery level.

## Sample Requirements
